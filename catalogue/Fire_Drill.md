# Fire Drill
**Also Known As:**
## Summary
Prolonged Requirements and Analysis phases by management, who want to do them "just right". Then frantic "everything needs to be done yesterday" period when management finds out they wasted most of project's schedule.
## Symptoms
 - rock-edge burndown (especially when viewing implementation tasks only)
 - for too long only activities connected to requirements, anylsis and planning occur with nothing designed or implemented
 - only analytical or documentational artefacts for a long time
 - sudden increase in development efforts with little to none testing and poor quality
 - many bugs, poor documantation of progress and product
 - stark contrast between interlevel communication in project hierarchy (management - developers) during the first phase (close to silence) and after realizating the problem (panic and loud noise)
