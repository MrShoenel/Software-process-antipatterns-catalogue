# Half Done Is Enough
**Also Known As:**
## Summary
Major enhancements or changes are required to an existing deployed system with high technical debt, which exist because of management being overly focused on "visible" progress, i.e.: only increasing functionality matters and testing and maintenance is diminished or ignored.
## Symptoms
 - little focus on activities other than pure implementation
 - little to no testing, maintenance, refactoring, focus on reusability, proper analysis and design
 - rising technical debt
 - project is slipping - slower feature rate, higher bug rate, postponing deadlines
 - prolonged periods of bugfixing and other maintenance necessary
