# Architects Don't Code
**Also Known As:** (pattern "Architect Also Implements")
## Summary
System architects do not participate in the development efforts, e.g. because their time is expensive. Thus they ultimately create designs just "on paper" which might be flawed but which the developers are supposed to follow, or are not able to estimate/understand how changes in their design affect the project.
## Symptoms
 - people with the architect role do not interact with coding tasks (tickets)
 - architects do not generate or modify any source code artifacts
 - architects only interact with non-coding tasks (tickets) and artifacts
 - (maybe?) implementation lags, or large refactorings are performed late in the project, or bugs on non-functional properties (e.g. performance) are reported after system is deployed to production
