## Summary
An idea that adding more resources (developers) to the project will increase productivity, pace or quality has the opposite effect. As oppose to [Brooks' Law](Brooks_Law.md), the concern is not an overdue project, but slower pace and drop in productivity and quality in general. Therefore failure to meet mid-project milestones, release criteria, etc.
## Symptoms
 - adding new people mid project
 - the overall productivity stays the same (productivity per capita drops) or drops
 - higher bug rate per developer, lower feature rate per developer, higher duplicate ratio
 - higher communication overhead due to new people getting acquainted with the project
 - underdelivering or overdue releases, milestones postponed
