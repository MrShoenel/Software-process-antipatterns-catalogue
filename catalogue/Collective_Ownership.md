# Collective Ownership
**Also Known As:**
## Summary
System modules are developed in quasi-equal measure by many developers. Therefore noone has the ownership and complete overview of the module's functionality and implementation details making precise, systematic and maintainable changes harder or even impossible.
## Symptoms
 - a certain larger logical piece of code (e.g., module) has no definite owner
 - module is frequently modified by several people to the similar extend
 - changes by other developers are not approved, verified or documented by the module's owner
## Specific To
projects using Agile methodologies
