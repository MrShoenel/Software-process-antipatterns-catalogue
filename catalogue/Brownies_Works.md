# Brownie's Works
**Also Known As:**
## Summary
Junior members actively write and commit code but their code is changed completely different by a senior before it gets to the customer. The motivation of juniors goes away. A side effect of Collective Ownership and violation of pair programming by Refactoring alone. The root cause is the senior's lack of sense of team building.
## Symptoms
 - junior developer (a person relatively new to the project) commits code
 - the code is rewritten by a senior developer before the next release
 - the senior's change relates to the same ticket
 - no sign of pair programming/refactoring
